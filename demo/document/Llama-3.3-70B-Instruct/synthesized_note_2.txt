### Patient Information
The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented to the clinic for a routine check-up and to discuss concerns regarding his blood pressure management.

### Chief Complaint
The patient's chief complaint is that he has been experiencing elevated blood pressure readings over the past few months, despite adhering to his medication regimen and making lifestyle modifications as recommended by his healthcare provider.

### History of Present Illness
The patient reports that he was first diagnosed with hypertension approximately 5 years ago. Since then, he has been managed with a combination of lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions. He has been taking a beta-blocker and an ACE inhibitor as prescribed by his doctor. However, over the past few months, he has noticed that his blood pressure readings have been consistently higher than his target range, prompting him to seek further evaluation and guidance.

### Past Medical History
The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a family history of cardiovascular disease. He does not have any known allergies to medications.

### Social History
The patient is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol in moderation. He works as an office administrator and reports a sedentary lifestyle, although he attempts to incorporate physical activity into his daily routine by taking short walks during his breaks.

### Family History
The patient's family history is notable for cardiovascular disease, with both his father and grandfather having suffered from heart attacks in their early 60s.

### Review of Systems
- **Cardiovascular:** The patient denies any symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations.
- **Neurological:** No symptoms of dizziness, headaches, or confusion.
- **Gastrointestinal:** No abdominal pain, nausea, or changes in bowel habits.

### Physical Examination
- **Vital Signs:** Blood pressure 150/90 mmHg, heart rate 80 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
- **General Appearance:** The patient appears well, with no signs of distress.
- **Cardiovascular Examination:** Regular heart rhythm without murmurs, and no peripheral edema.
- **Neurological Examination:** Normal mental status, with no focal neurological deficits.

### Laboratory Results
Recent laboratory results show:
- **Lipid Profile:** Total cholesterol 200 mg/dL, LDL 120 mg/dL, HDL 40 mg/dL, triglycerides 150 mg/dL.
- **Blood Glucose:** Fasting glucose 90 mg/dL.
- **Renal Function:** Serum creatinine 1.0 mg/dL, eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73m^2.

### Assessment and Plan
The patient's elevated blood pressure readings despite current management suggest the need for adjustment of his antihypertensive regimen. Considering his past medical history and laboratory results, the following plan is proposed:
- **Medication Adjustment:** Increase the dose of the ACE inhibitor and consider adding a calcium channel blocker to enhance blood pressure control.
- **Lifestyle Modifications:** Encourage increased physical activity, aiming for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per day, and provide dietary counseling to reduce sodium intake and promote a heart-healthy diet.
- **Follow-Up:** Schedule a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks to reassess blood pressure control and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.

### Conclusion
The management of hypertension requires a multifaceted approach, including pharmacological therapy, lifestyle modifications, and regular monitoring. By adjusting the patient's medication regimen and emphasizing the importance of lifestyle changes, we aim to achieve better control of his blood pressure and reduce his risk of cardiovascular complications.
