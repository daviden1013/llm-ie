### Patient Information
The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented to the clinic for a routine check-up and to discuss concerns regarding his blood pressure management.

### Chief Complaint
The patient's chief complaint is that he has been experiencing elevated blood pressure readings over the past few months, despite adhering to his prescribed medication regimen and making lifestyle modifications.

### History of Present Illness
The patient reports that he was first diagnosed with hypertension approximately 5 years ago. Since then, he has been managed with a combination of lifestyle changes and pharmacotherapy. However, over the past 6 months, he has noticed an increase in his blood pressure readings, with systolic pressures often exceeding 140 mmHg and diastolic pressures ranging from 90-100 mmHg.

### Past Medical History
The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, for which he is currently taking a statin. He also has a family history of cardiovascular disease, with his father having suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 60.

### Medications
The patient is currently taking the following medications:
- Amlodipine 10mg daily for blood pressure management
- Atorvastatin 20mg daily for hyperlipidemia
- Aspirin 81mg daily for cardiovascular risk reduction

### Social History
The patient is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol in moderation. He exercises regularly, typically engaging in 30 minutes of brisk walking 3-4 times per week. His diet is balanced, with an emphasis on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

### Review of Systems
- **Cardiovascular:** The patient denies any symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations.
- **Neurological:** No symptoms of dizziness, headaches, or confusion.
- **Gastrointestinal:** No abdominal pain, nausea, or changes in bowel habits.

### Physical Examination
- **Vital Signs:** Blood pressure 148/92 mmHg, heart rate 72 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
- **General Appearance:** The patient appears well, with no signs of distress.
- **Cardiovascular Examination:** Regular heart rhythm, no murmurs or gallops.
- **Abdominal Examination:** Soft and non-tender, with no palpable masses.

### Laboratory Results
Recent laboratory results show:
- **Lipid Profile:** Total cholesterol 180 mg/dL, LDL 100 mg/dL, HDL 40 mg/dL, triglycerides 150 mg/dL.
- **Basic Metabolic Panel:** Within normal limits, with a serum creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL.
- **Complete Blood Count:** Within normal limits.

### Assessment and Plan
The patient's elevated blood pressure readings despite current management suggest the need for adjustment of his antihypertensive regimen. Considering his history of hyperlipidemia and family history of cardiovascular disease, it is crucial to optimize his cardiovascular risk factors.

1. **Medication Adjustment:** Increase Amlodipine to 15mg daily and consider adding a second antihypertensive agent if blood pressure goals are not met within the next 6 weeks.
2. **Lifestyle Modifications:** Encourage continued adherence to a balanced diet, regular exercise, and moderation of alcohol intake. Consider referral to a dietitian for personalized dietary advice.
3. **Follow-Up:** Schedule a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks to reassess blood pressure control and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.

### Conclusion
The management of this patient's hypertension requires a multifaceted approach, including optimization of his medication regimen, reinforcement of lifestyle modifications, and close monitoring of his blood pressure. By working together, we aim to achieve better control of his blood pressure and reduce his risk of cardiovascular complications.
