### Assessment and Plan
The patient's elevated blood pressure readings despite current management suggest the need for adjustment of his antihypertensive regimen. Considering his current medications and laboratory results, the plan is to increase the dose of Lisinopril to 30mg daily and to add a beta-blocker, Metoprolol 50mg daily, to his regimen. The patient will also be counseled on further lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes to reduce sodium intake and increase physical activity. Follow-up is scheduled in 6 weeks to reassess blood pressure control and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.

### Patient Education
The patient was educated on the importance of adherence to his medication regimen, the role of lifestyle modifications in managing hypertension, and the need for regular follow-up to monitor his condition. He was also instructed on how to properly measure his blood pressure at home and to keep a log of his readings.

### Follow-Up
The patient is scheduled to return to the clinic in 6 weeks for a follow-up appointment to assess the effectiveness of the new treatment plan and to make any necessary adjustments.
