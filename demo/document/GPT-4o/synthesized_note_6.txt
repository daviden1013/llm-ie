## Assessment and Plan  

### Assessment:  
1. Persistent cough and shortness of breath, likely secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Differential includes asthma exacerbation, interstitial lung disease, or early pulmonary infection.  
2. Long-standing smoking history (30 pack-years), contributing to symptoms.  
3. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia, well-controlled.  

### Plan:  
1. **Diagnostics**:  
   - Order chest X-ray to evaluate for structural abnormalities or signs of infection.  
   - Pulmonary function tests to assess for COPD or other respiratory pathology.  
   - Basic metabolic panel and complete blood count.  

2. **Treatment**:  
   - Start albuterol inhaler (90 mcg per actuation) as needed for symptomatic relief.  
   - Encourage smoking cessation with nicotine replacement therapy and referral to a smoking cessation program.  

3. **Lifestyle**:  
   - Discuss dietary modifications and regular exercise to optimize overall health.  

4. **Follow-Up**:  
   - Schedule a follow-up visit in two weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen.
