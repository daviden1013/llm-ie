## Assessment and Plan  

### Assessment:  
1. Right lower quadrant abdominal pain, likely acute appendicitis.  
2. Nausea and vomiting, secondary to abdominal pathology.  
3. History of migraines, stable.  

### Plan:  
1. **Diagnostics**:  
   - Order abdominal ultrasound and CT abdomen/pelvis to confirm the diagnosis.  
   - CBC and CMP to evaluate for leukocytosis and electrolyte imbalances.  
   - Urinalysis to rule out urinary tract infection or nephrolithiasis.  
   - Serum beta-HCG to rule out pregnancy.  

2. **Treatment**:  
   - NPO status in preparation for possible surgery.  
   - Start IV fluids (normal saline) for hydration.  
   - Administer IV ondansetron for nausea.  
   - Initiate empiric antibiotics (ceftriaxone and metronidazole) after confirming no contraindications.  

3. **Referral**:  
   - Consult general surgery for evaluation and possible appendectomy.  

4. **Follow-Up**:  
   - Continuous monitoring for any worsening symptoms or signs of peritonitis.
