Follow-up for poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and complaints of occasional dizziness and blurred vision.

## Summary of Visit  
Michael Green, a 62-year-old male with a known history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, presents for follow-up regarding his glycemic control. Despite recent adjustments to his treatment plan, his glucose readings have remained elevated, averaging 180-220 mg/dL. He reports occasional episodes of dizziness and blurred vision, particularly in the morning before meals. He denies chest pain, palpitations, or recent falls. He reports compliance with his medication regimen but admits to difficulty following a consistent low-carbohydrate diet.

Michael has been using a glucose meter to monitor his blood sugar levels and logs them daily. His last hemoglobin A1c, performed three months ago, was 9.2%. He reports no recent hospitalizations, infections, or significant stressors.

- Fasting glucose: 192 mg/dL.

- Urine microalbumin: 60 mg/g (elevated).

## Assessment and Plan  

### Assessment:  
1. Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus with elevated A1c and fasting glucose.  
2. Hypertension, sub-optimally controlled with current therapy.  
3. Obesity contributing to worsening glycemic control.  
4. Evidence of early diabetic nephropathy (elevated urine microalbumin).  
5. Symptoms of dizziness and blurred vision, likely related to fluctuating glucose levels.  

### Plan:  
1. **Diabetes Management**:  
   - Add empagliflozin 10 mg daily to improve glycemic control and provide renal protection.  
   - Referral to a diabetes educator for nutritional counseling and meal planning.  
   - Continue daily glucose monitoring; consider continuous glucose monitoring if feasible.  
   - Recheck A1c and renal function in 3 months.  

2. **Hypertension Management**:  
   - Increase lisinopril to 40 mg daily to target both blood pressure and renal protection.  

3. **Lifestyle Recommendations**:  
   - Set a weight-loss goal of 5-10% over the next 6 months.  
   - Encourage regular physical activity (walking 30 minutes, 5 times per week).  
   - Refer to a structured weight-loss program if patient is amenable.  

4. **Dizziness and Blurred Vision**:  
   - Monitor for hypoglycemia, especially with the addition of empagliflozin.  
   - Counsel patient to recognize and manage symptoms of low blood sugar.  

5. **Follow-Up**:  
   - Schedule a follow-up visit in 3 months to reassess blood pressure, glucose levels, and renal function.  
   - Advise patient to seek care sooner if symptoms worsen or new concerns arise.
