## Assessment and Plan  

### Assessment:  
1. Persistent fatigue and unintentional weight loss, etiology unclear but concerning for metabolic, endocrine, or autoimmune disorder.  
2. High stress levels, contributing to reported symptoms.  
3. Family history of thyroid dysfunction and autoimmune disease.  

### Plan:  
1. **Diagnostics**:  
   - Expedite lab tests for thyroid dysfunction, anemia, and inflammatory markers.  
   - Add C-reactive protein (CRP) and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) if autoimmune process is suspected based on results.  

2. **Lifestyle and Support**:  
   - Encourage stress management techniques, such as mindfulness and regular physical activity.  
   - Suggest trial of a balanced diet with adequate caloric intake to prevent further weight loss.  

3. **Follow-Up**:  
   - Review lab results within one week via phone or telehealth.  
   - Schedule in-person follow-up in two weeks to discuss findings and adjust the plan if needed.  

4. **Counseling**:  
   - Reassure the patient that her symptoms will be carefully evaluated.  
   - Advise to report any new symptoms such as fever, worsening fatigue, or joint swelling.
