## History  
**History of Present Illness**:  
Sarah Williams, a 37-year-old female, reports a 5-day history of persistent headache and neck stiffness. She describes the headache as a dull, bilateral pain that worsens with movement and improves slightly with over-the-counter analgesics. She also notes mild photophobia and fatigue but denies nausea, vomiting, fever, or recent trauma.

Sarah works as a software developer and spends long hours at her desk. She attributes her symptoms to stress and prolonged computer use but is concerned about their persistence despite rest and self-care measures.

## Initial Assessment  
1. Persistent headache with neck stiffness, likely tension-type headache exacerbated by prolonged posture and stress. Differential includes migraine variant or early signs of meningitis (low suspicion without fever or photophobia worsening).  
2. History of migraines, currently well-controlled.

## Management Plan  

1. **Immediate Care**:  
   - Prescribe cyclobenzaprine 5 mg nightly for muscle relaxation.  
   - Continue ibuprofen as needed for pain, but limit use to avoid medication-overuse headache.  

2. **Lifestyle Adjustments**:  
   - Recommend frequent breaks during computer use (20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds).  
   - Suggest ergonomic adjustments to her workstation to improve posture.  
   - Encourage stress reduction techniques such as mindfulness or yoga.  

3. **Diagnostics**:  
   - If symptoms persist or worsen, consider imaging (MRI of the brain and cervical spine) to rule out other causes.  
   - Monitor for warning signs such as worsening photophobia, fever, or focal neurological deficits that may warrant lumbar puncture or additional evaluation.  

4. **Follow-Up**:  
   - Schedule a follow-up visit in 2 weeks to reassess symptoms. Advise the patient to seek immediate care if she develops fever, vomiting, or worsening neck stiffness.
