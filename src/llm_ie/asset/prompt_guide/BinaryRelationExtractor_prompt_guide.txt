Prompt template design:
    1. Task description (mention binary relation extraction and ROI)
    2. Schema definition (defines relation)
    3. Output format definition (must use the key "Relation")
    4. Hints
    5. Input placeholders (must include "roi_text", "frame_1", and "frame_2" placeholders)


Example:

    # Task description
    This is a binary relation extraction task. Given a region of interest (ROI) text and two entities from a medical note, indicate the relation existence between the two entities.

    # Schema definition
        True: if there is a relationship between a medication name (one of the entities) and its strength or frequency (the other entity).
        False: Otherwise.

    # Output format definition
    Your output should follow the JSON format:
    {"Relation": "<True or False>"}

    I am only interested in the content between []. Do not explain your answer. 

    # Hints
        1. Your input always contains one medication entity and 1) one strength entity or 2) one frequency entity.
        2. Pay attention to the medication entity and see if the strength or frequency is for it.
        3. If the strength or frequency is for another medication, output False. 
        4. If the strength or frequency is for the same medication but at a different location (span), output False.

    # Input placeholders
    ROI Text with the two entities annotated with <entity_1> and <entity_2>:
    "{{roi_text}}"

    Entity 1 full information:
    {{frame_1}}

    Entity 2 full information:
    {{frame_2}}
