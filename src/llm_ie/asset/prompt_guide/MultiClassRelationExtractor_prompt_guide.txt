Prompt Template Design:

1. Task description:
   Provide a detailed description of the task, including the background and the type of task (e.g., binary relation extraction). Mention the region of interest (ROI) text. 
2. Schema definition: 
   List the criterion for relation (True) and for no relation (False).

3. Output format definition:
   This section must include a placeholder "{{pos_rel_types}}" for the possible relation types.
   The ouptut must be a dictionary with a key "RelationType" (i.e., {"RelationType": "<relation type or No Relation>"}).

4. (optional) Hints:
   Provide itemized hints for the information extractors to guide the extraction process.

5. (optional) Examples:
   Include examples in the format:  
    Input: ...  
    Output: ...

6. Entity 1 full information:
   Include a placeholder in the format {{<frame_1>}}

7. Entity 2 full information:
   Include a placeholder in the format {{<frame_2>}}

8. Input placeholders:
   The template must include a placeholder "{{roi_text}}" for the ROI text.



Example:

    # Task description
    This is a multi-class relation extraction task. Given a region of interest (ROI) text and two frames from a medical note, classify the relation types between the two frames. 

    # Schema definition
        Strength-Drug: this is a relationship between the drug strength and its name. 
        Dosage-Drug: this is a relationship between the drug dosage and its name.
        Duration-Drug: this is a relationship between a drug duration and its name.
        Frequency-Drug: this is a relationship between a drug frequency and its name.
        Form-Drug: this is a relationship between a drug form and its name.
        Route-Drug: this is a relationship between the route of administration for a drug and its name.
        Reason-Drug: this is a relationship between the reason for which a drug was administered (e.g., symptoms, diseases, etc.) and a drug name.
        ADE-Drug: this is a relationship between an adverse drug event (ADE) and a drug name.

    # Output format definition
    Choose one of the relation types listed below or choose "No Relation":
    {{pos_rel_types}}

    Your output should follow the JSON format:
    {"RelationType": "<relation type or No Relation>"}

    I am only interested in the content between []. Do not explain your answer. 

    # Hints
        1. Your input always contains one medication entity and 1) one strength entity or 2) one frequency entity.
        2. Pay attention to the medication entity and see if the strength or frequency is for it.
        3. If the strength or frequency is for another medication, output "No Relation". 
        4. If the strength or frequency is for the same medication but at a different location (span), output "No Relation".

    # Entity 1 full information:
    {{frame_1}}

    # Entity 2 full information:
    {{frame_2}}

    # Input placeholders
    ROI Text with the two entities annotated with <entity_1> and <entity_2>:
    "{{roi_text}}"
